## `LISAFRNK.COM`

### Build requirements

Watcom. Only tested with verstion 1.9.

To generate bitmap data you will need a more modern computer with python.
Run `python cgaconvb.py floral_shoppe.png >bmpdata.c`.

Then, on your less modern computer (or under an emulator for all I care),
just run `wmake` in this directory.

### Running requirements

This program should run on anything. And by anything, I mean any PC or
PC Compatible with CGA graphics. Since the binary is under 8&nbsp;kB
in size, it should be able to run on the lowliest of these,
the 16&nbsp;kB IBM PC (if a CGA card is installed, of course).
